*  To help predict and analyze weather data, NASA partners closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): https://www.noaa.gov/
*  You can access NOAA data several ways. At NOAA Data Access: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access
*  Collect data at Data.NASA.gov: https://data.nasa.gov/
*  NASA also provides developer resources: https://data.nasa.gov/stories/s/gk8h-th3y
*  NASA collects data from a wide array of sources, including these sources:High-atmospheric scientific balloons, NOAA weather, Satellite imagery, Remote sensors, Weather pattern experts.https://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/learn/remote-sensors,  https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/GOES/
